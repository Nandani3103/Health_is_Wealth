Healthy eating habits also include replacing foods that contain trans fats, added salt, and sugar with more nutritious options.</p>

     <p>Following a healthy diet has many benefits, including building strong bones, protecting the heart, preventing disease, and boosting the mood.</p>

    <p> This article discusses the top 10 benefits of a healthful diet and the evidence behind them.</p>

    <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, heart disease is the leading cause of death for adults in the United States.</p>

        <p><a href="The American Heart Association (AHA)" > The American Herats Association(AHA)</a> Source states that almost half of U.S. adults live with some form of cardiovascular disease.</p>
        
        <p>High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a growing concern in the U.S. The condition can lead to a heart attack, heart failure, and a stroke.</p>
        
        <p>It may be possible to prevent up to 80% of premature heart disease and stroke diagnoses with lifestyle changes, such as increasing physical activity and healthful eating.</p>
        
        <p>The foods people eat can reduce their blood pressure and help keep their hearts healthy.</p>
        
        <p>The DASH diet, or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, includes plenty of heart healthy foods. The program recommendsTrusted Source:</p>
        <ul >
           <li>eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains</li>
            <li>choosing fat-free or low fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils</li>
            <li> saturated and trans fat intake, such as fatty meats and full-fat dairy products</li>
            <li>limiting drinks and foods that contain added sugars</li>
            <li>restricting sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day — ideally 1,500 mg daily — and increasing consumption of potassium, magnesium, and calcium</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A healthful diet may help maintain cognition and brain health. However, further conclusive research is necessary.</p>

            <p>A 2015 study identified nutrients and foods that protect against cognitive decline and dementia. The researchers found the following to be beneficial:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>vitamin D, C, and E</li>
            <li>omega-3 fatty acids</li>
            <li>flavonoids and polyphenols</li>

    <p>There is a Sanskrit proverb that says, “For breath is life; if you breathe well, you will live long on Earth.” Contemporary science agrees. It doesn’t seem to matter whether we use diaphragmatic breathing (also called belly breathing), deep ribcage breathing, or a specific pranayama technique. Research suggests that slow, deep breathing can trigger the relaxation response in the central nervous system, which in turn slows respiration and heart rate, reduces blood pressure, soothes digestion, enhances energy, and reduces stress and perceived pain.</p>

    <h2>TADASANA</h2>
        <img src="https://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Tadasana-pose.jpg" width="500px">
        <a href="https://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Tadasana-pose.jpg">Tadasana</a>
        <p>Most of us spend an hour, at most, practicing yoga. This means that what you do off the mat has exponentially more impact on your health than what you do on it. Every time we find our roots in Mountain Pose, one of the most basic yoga poses, we are encouraged to notice and correct our postural habits. This helps us to new habits that we can take into each moment of our day. Your posture influences your breathing, digestion, and mood, and over time, it can even create asymmetric strain on your joints, leading to premature wear and injury.</p>

    <h2>RECLINING TWIST</h2>

    <p>A gentle twist is the basic yoga pose equivalent of hitting reset and releasing myofascial tension in the back and side body and encouraging the intervertebral disks between the bones of the spine to allow for easier movement.

    <h2>MEDITATION</h2>

    <a href="https://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Meditation-and-Success.jpeg">Meditation</a>
    <p>Regular meditation, regardless of its style or duration, has been shown to boost immunity, focus, and creativity, while reducing anxiety, stress, and perceived pain. No matter what other basic yoga poses you can or cannot practice, these powerful and long-lasting benefits are available whenever you can find a comfortable seat to pause, sidestep your thoughts, and observe your breath for even a few minutes a day.</p>
