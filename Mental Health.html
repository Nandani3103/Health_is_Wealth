                                  <p>Mental health problems can have a wide range of causes. It's likely that for many people there is a complicated combination of factors. Although different people may be more deeply affected by certain things than others.

                                  <p>People with these conditions have severe fear or anxiety related to certain objects or situations. Most people with an anxiety disorder try to avoid exposure to whatever triggers their anxiety.</p>

                                  <p>They may experience excessive anxiety when encountering everyday situations that do not pose a direct danger, such as chores or appointments. A person with GAD may sometimes feel anxiety with no trigger at all.</p>

                                  <ul>
                                      <li>
                                          <b>Simple phobias:</b>
                                          These may involve a disproportionate fear of specific objects, scenarios, or animals. A fear of spiders is a typical example.

                                          Sometimes known as social anxiety, this is a fear of being subject to the judgment of others. People with social phobia often restrict their exposure to social environments.

                                          This term refers to a fear of situations where getting away may be difficult, such as being in an elevator or a moving train. Many people misunderstand this phobia as the fear of being outside.

                                   <p>Phobias are deeply personal, and doctors do not know every type. There could be thousands of phobias, and what may seem unusual to one person can be a severe problem that dominates daily life for another.</p>

                                  <p>PTSD can occur after a person experiences or witnesses an intensely stressful or traumatic event. During this type of event, the person thinks that their life or other people’s lives are in danger.
