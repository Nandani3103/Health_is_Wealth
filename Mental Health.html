                                  <p>There are different types of phobia:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                      <li>
                                          <b>Simple phobias:</b>
                                          These may involve a disproportionate fear of specific objects, scenarios, or animals. A fear of spiders is a typical example.

                                      <li>

                                          Sometimes known as social anxiety, this is a fear of being subject to the judgment of others. People with social phobia often restrict their exposure to social environments.

                                          This term refers to a fear of situations where getting away may be difficult, such as being in an elevator or a moving train. Many people misunderstand this phobia as the fear of being outside.

                                   <p>Phobias are deeply personal, and doctors do not know every type. There could be thousands of phobias, and what may seem unusual to one person can be a severe problem that dominates daily life for another.</p>

                                  <p>PTSD can occur after a person experiences or witnesses an intensely stressful or traumatic event. During this type of event, the person thinks that their life or other peopleâ€™s lives are in danger.
